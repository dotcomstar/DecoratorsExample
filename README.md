## Botball Concept Difficulty: Advanced
An example of how to use Python decorators for Botball.

Further reading can be found at https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/.

Note: The code on this repository contains modified versions of the examples from this link, tailored for use in teaching Botball students.


## :file_folder: Code Structure
The code is broken up as follows:

- `functionargumentexample.py`: A standalone module showing how functions can be passed in as arguments to other functions. This functionality is not available in Java nor C, as far as I am aware.
- `decorators.py`: Examples of actual decorators, and explanations of how they are used.
- `main.py`: Calls the decorators defined in `decorators.py`.
- `expected_output_(module name).txt`: The output of the given module.
