Further reading can be found at https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/.

Note: The code on this repository contains modified versions of the examples from this link, tailored for use in teaching Botball students.

## How to navigate this repository:
The file `functionargumentexample.py` is a standalone module showing how functions can be passed in as arguments to other functions. This functionality is not available in Java nor C, as far as I am aware.

The file `decorators.py` contains examples of actual decorators, and explanations of how they are used.

The file `main.py` contains calls to the decorators defined in `decorators.py`.

The output of all the modules can be found in the text files named `expected_output_(module name).txt`.
